Quantum Information-Related Filters for Bibolamazi
==================================================

This repository defines a [bibolamazi](https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi)
filter package with a couple filters that are loosely related to bibliography
databases relating to physics and quantum information.


To use these filters in a bibolamazi file, use the following directive in your
bibolamazi file:

    package: github:phfaist/bibolamazi-qi-filters
    
This only works with Bibolamazi â‰¥ 4.2.  (If I haven't released this version yet,
you will need to use the development version by cloning the github repo.)
